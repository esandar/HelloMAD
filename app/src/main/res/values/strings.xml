        This game is played just like
        regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
        you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
        \n\
        A tie happens when there are no further moves.
        In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
        both sides in the larger game.

        This game has two phases. In the first 90 seconds, you have to select one word
        from each small board, total nine words. You have to finish one board before moving to others.
        The word has to have more than three letters.
        You need to click to submit your choice.\n\
        If you do not pick at least three words. The game will not enter Phase 2 due to lack of selection (Dialogue will pop up). \n\
        Otherwise when time is up, you will move to the next phase.
        In Phase #2, you will have another 90 seconds. You can only select one from each small board.Try to make as many words
        as you can within the time limit.\n\
        GREEN tiles are the available ones you can make a valid move.\n\
        RED tiles are frozen which you cannot make a valid move.\n\
        BLUE tiles shows the letters you already pick.\n\
        GREY tiles are the inactive ones which you have done with.\n\
        Enjoy the game!
