        This game is played just like
        regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
        you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
        \n\
        A tie happens when there are no further moves.
        In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
        both sides in the larger game.

        This game has two phases. In the first 90 seconds, you have to select 9 words from 9 of the
        3x3 grids. You have to finish one grid before moving to others. The word has to have more than three letters.
        You need to click to submit your choice.\n\
        When you finish 9 selections or the time is up, you will move to the next phase.
        You can only select one from all available letters in each big grid to make a new word. Try to make as many
        as you can within the time limit.\n\
